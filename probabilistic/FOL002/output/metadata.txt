# metadata for /output/ folder
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all files from the initial PWC simulation 
(the deterministic simulation).  These files were copied from the
deterministic/FOL002/input/ folder.

This deterministic simulation uses this site's initial variable values.
As a result, these files are used as the base for the probabilistic R 
scripts.  The probabilistic R scripts read these files and iteratively
edit them by replacing each of the input variables values with the randomly 
sampled LHS values.

Note: these files were created with PWC version 1.59.  It requires a .wea file,
not a .dvf.


Below is a brief description of each file.
