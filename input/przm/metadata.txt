# metadata for /input/przm/ folder
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all files -- that are specific to PRZM -- from 
the initial PWC simulation (using this study's initial variables of 
interest and their respective values). As a result, these files are 
used as the base for the R scripts concerning the PRZM.  The R 
scripts concerning PRZM read these files and edit them by replacing 
the input variables with the randomly sampled LHS amounts for each 
input variable.

Note: these files are copies of those in /output/


Below is a brief description of each file.

PRZM5.inp					PRZM input file
vvwmTransfer.txt				VVWM input file
...input# folders				specific PWC simulation using LHS input variables
