# metadata for /input/vvwm/ folder
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all files -- that are specific to VVWM -- from 
the initial PWC simulation (using this study's initial variables of 
interest and their respective values). As a result, these files are 
used as the base for the R scripts concerning the VVWM.  The R 
scripts concerning VVWM read these files and edit them by replacing 
the input variables with the randomly sampled LHS amounts for each 
input variable.

Note: these files are copies from those in /output/


Below is a brief description of each file.

vvwmTransfer.txt				VVWM input file
...all "December.." files			PWC output files for each waterbody scenario and chemical (parent/degradate)
