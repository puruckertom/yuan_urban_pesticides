# metadata for /output/ folder
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all files from the initial PWC simulation 
(using this study's initial variables of interest and their respective 
values). As a result, these files are used as the base for the R 
scripts concerning the PWC.  The R scripts concerning PWC read these 
files and edit them by replacing the input variables with the randomly 
sampled LHS amounts for each input variable.

Note: these files were created with PWC version 1.59
