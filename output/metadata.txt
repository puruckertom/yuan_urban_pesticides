# metadata for /output/ folder
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all files from the initial PWC simulation (using
this study's initial variables of interest and their respective
values). As a result, these files are all used as the base for the R 
scripts...the R scripts read these files and edit them by replacing 
the input variables with the randomly sampled LHS amounts for each input
variable.

Note: copies of these files are also in /input/przm/ and /input/vvwm/
Note: these files were created with PWC version 1.59


Below is a brief description of each file.
