# metadata for /input/FOL002/ folder
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all files from PWC deterministic simulation.
This simulation was NOT done in the PWC GUI but was ran with the
src/02_run_pwc.R script.

Note: this deterministic simulation is comprised of daily application
rates from 2009 - 2014 (for a total of 2191 application rates). These
application rates were computed from observed CALPIP data.  This data 
can be found in the output_for_pwc__with_ma_folsom.txt located at
C:\Users\echelsvi\git\yuan_urban_pesticides\bifenthrin_application_rates\CALPIP.
The data in this text file was copy-paste into the PRZM5.inp that is in the 
/input/FOL002/ folder.  The outputs from the PWC simulation were output
to the /input/FOL002/outputs folder.

Note: these files were created with PWC version 1.59.  It requires a .wea file,
not a .dvf.


Below is a brief description of each file.

PRZM5.inp					PRZM input file (has the 2191 application rates)
vvwmTransfer.txt				VVWM input file
17484_grid_folsom.wea				Weather file
